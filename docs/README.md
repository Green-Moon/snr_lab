# Confused?

here is an example. Say I want to transpose this page of sheet music:
 ![](beet.png)
 ![20%](beet.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}
 ![](beet.png | width=24){:height="12px" width="12px"}
 <img src="beet.png" width="200"/>

First, I would take a picture of it, and save that picture as a 
.png file. 

Then, I would upload the png file to this page, where it says "upload your picture here"
