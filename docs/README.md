# Confused?

here is an example. Say I want to transpose this page of sheet music: 




<img src="beet.png" width="200"/> 
 
First, I would take a picture of it, and save that picture as a 
.png file. (The picture I show above is a .png)

Then, I would upload the png file to this page, where it says "upload your picture here"

As you can see, 
this picture is in the key of INSERT KEY HERE 
in the INSERT OCTAVE HERE octave. 
(Click the following links for information on how to figure out what 
[key](https://www.themusicalear.com/how-to-identify-key-signatures/) 
or 
[octave](http://slideplayer.com/2815825/10/images/16/Note+Names+and+Frequencies.jpg)
 your piece is in.)

So, I would type KEY
